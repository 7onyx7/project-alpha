Production Readiness Checklist
=============================

1. Caching
-----------
[✓] Implement server-side caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for frequent queries/data.
    - Message history query now uses PostgreSQL with limit 100 for efficiency
[✓] Use HTTP caching headers for static assets (images, CSS, JS).
[✓] Enable client-side caching where appropriate.

2. Security
-----------
[✓] Use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) everywhere.
[✓] Sanitize and validate all user inputs (prevent XSS, SQL injection, etc.).
    - Using parameterized queries for SQL
    - Encoding usernames for message history
[✓] Use secure authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT, hashed passwords with bcrypt/argon2).
    - Basic authentication implemented
[✓] Implement authorization checks for all sensitive endpoints.
[✓] Set secure HTTP headers (Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
[✓] Store secrets (API keys, DB passwords) securely (environment variables, secret managers).
    - Using .env for database credentials
[✓] Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
[✓] Enable rate limiting and brute-force protection.
[✓] Use CSRF protection for forms and state-changing requests.
[✓] Log security events and monitor for suspicious activity.

3. Performance
--------------
[✓] Optimize database queries and add indexes where needed.
    - Limited message history query to 100 messages
[✓] Minify and bundle frontend assets.
[✓] Use a CDN for static assets.
[✓] Lazy load images and components.
[✓] Enable GZIP or Brotli compression.

4. Error Handling & Logging
---------------------------
[✓] Implement centralized error logging (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket, Winston).
    - Using Winston for structured logging and Sentry for error monitoring
[✓] Show user-friendly error messages.
    - Added system messages for room status
[✓] Set up alerts for critical errors.
    - Sentry alerts configured

5. Testing
----------
[✓] Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
    - Basic tests and test setup present
[✓] Set up automated test pipelines (CI/CD).
    - CI/CD pipeline configured
[✓] Test for edge cases and failure scenarios.
    - Edge cases covered in manual and automated tests

6. Deployment & Scalability
---------------------------
[✓] Use environment variables for configuration.
    - Using .env for database credentials
[✓] Containerize the app (e.g., Docker).
[✓] Set up CI/CD for automated deployments.
[✓] Ensure horizontal scalability (stateless servers, load balancers).
[✓] Prepare for database migrations and backups.

7. Monitoring & Analytics
------------------------
[✓] Set up application and server monitoring (Sentry, Winston).
    - Sentry and Winston active for error and event monitoring
[ ] Track usage analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel).
[✓] Monitor uptime and performance.
    - Sentry alerts configured

8. Documentation
----------------
[✓] Document API endpoints (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI).
    - Added in README.md
[✓] Provide setup and deployment instructions.
    - Added in README.md
[✓] Maintain a changelog and release notes.
    - CHANGELOG.md maintained

9. Accessibility & Internationalization
--------------------------------------
[✓] Ensure accessibility (WCAG compliance).
[ ] Support localization/internationalization if needed.

10. Chat App Specific Requirements
----------------------
[✓] Message persistence
    - Messages saved to PostgreSQL database
    - Message history loaded when joining a room
[✓] Room management
    - Auto-pairing users into rooms of 2
    - Room cleanup on user disconnect
[✓] Socket event handling
    - Fixed duplicate event handlers
    - Added proper room joining/leaving logic
    - Implemented socket reconnection for tab switching
[✓] User experience
    - Added system messages for waiting, room ready, etc.
    - Added styling for system messages
    - ESC key to leave chat
    - Fixed tab switching disconnect issue with visibilitychange and reconnection
