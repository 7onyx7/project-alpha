üîç MANUAL TEST: Duplicate User Prevention Fix

## Test Scenario
Test that logging in as the same user from multiple locations doesn't create duplicate entries in the active users list.

## Test Steps

### 1. Open Two Browser Windows/Tabs
- Open Chrome/Firefox and go to http://localhost:3000
- Open a new Incognito/Private window and go to http://localhost:3000
- OR use two different browsers entirely

### 2. Login as Admin in Both Windows
- In both windows, login with:
  - Username: admin
  - Password: admin123!

### 3. Navigate to Chat in Both Windows
- After login, both windows should redirect to the chat page
- You should see the active users list on the right side

### 4. Check Active Users List
- Look at the "Active Users" section on the right side of the chat
- You should see only ONE "admin" entry, not two

### 5. Test Admin Panel
- Click the "Admin Panel" button in both windows
- This should NOT create additional user entries
- The active users list should still show only one "admin"

### 6. Test Room Switching
- In one window, join a specific room by adding ?room=test to the URL
- In the other window, join the same room
- Check that only one "admin" appears in the user list

## Expected Results ‚úÖ

1. **Single User Entry**: Only one "admin" should appear in the active users list
2. **No Duplicates**: Multiple login sessions should not create duplicate entries
3. **Proper Cleanup**: When one window is closed, the user should remain in the list from the other window
4. **Admin Panel Works**: Admin panel access should not create duplicate sessions

## What Was Fixed

The fix implemented:
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Before joining a room, the system now checks if the username already exists in ANY room
- **Room Switching**: If a user exists in another room, they are removed from the old room before joining the new one
- **Socket Management**: Multiple socket connections from the same user are properly handled
- **Cleanup**: Better cleanup of disconnected users to prevent orphaned entries

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Only one "admin" entry appears in active users list
‚úÖ Admin panel button works without creating duplicates  
‚úÖ Room switching doesn't create duplicate entries
‚úÖ Multiple browser windows/tabs don't create duplicates
‚úÖ Proper cleanup when windows are closed

## If Test Fails

If you still see duplicate users:
1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Verify that both windows are actually logged in as the same user
3. Try refreshing both windows
4. Check that the server is running the latest code

## Server Status
Server running on: http://localhost:3000
Admin panel: http://localhost:3000/admin/login

**Note**: This fix prevents duplicate socket connections from the same username from creating multiple entries in the active users list. The system now properly handles multiple connections from the same user account.
